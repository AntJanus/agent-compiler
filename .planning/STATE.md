## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Use lightweight TUI (prompts-style) — matches Next.js generator UX
- Concatenate only markdown files — non-markdown files aren't embeddable instructions
- Create backups before overwriting — safety net prevents data loss
- Parse YAML frontmatter from SKILL.md — needed to extract skill metadata

### Pending Todos
